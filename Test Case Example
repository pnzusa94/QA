Summary: 'held' and 'max_hold' fields in agents_activity and call_details tables for Chats = 0
Severity: major
Component: Aggregation
Found in Phase: QA Feature Testing
Version: X.X.x.x

Description: Preconditions: 1) Login in Admin portal, go to "Chat Services" tab and choose default chat service. Login an Agent in Agent's portal, swith him to "Ready"
Scenario:
* Start Chat1 interaction by Customer1
* Accept by the Agent
* Write some messages by each other
* Start Chat2 interaction by Customer2
* Accept by the Agent (Chat1 interaction is 'out of focus', Chat2 interaction is 'in focus')
* Write some messages by each other in Chat2
* Switch between interactions couple of times by Agent(to make them in focus/out of focus by turns), write something in Chats by anyone with every switch
* Complete Chat1 by Agent
* Complete Chat2 by Agent
* Wait System Aggregation time
* Check 'held' and 'max_hold' fields for those interactions in SQL (Execute: select * from agents_activity where chat_id = 777 then Execute: select * from call_details where chat_id = 888)

Expected Result: in both Tables:
Chat1 interaction ("777") - 'held' ~ 3-4, 'max_hold' ~ 15-30
Chat2 interaction ("888") - 'held' ~ 2-3, 'max_hold' ~ 20-30

Actual Result: in both Tables:
Chat1 interaction ("777") - 'held' = 0, 'max_hold' = 0
Chat2 interaction ("888") - 'held' = 0, 'max_hold' = 0
